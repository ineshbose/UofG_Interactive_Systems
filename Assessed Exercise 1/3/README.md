# Plan Evaluation

## What should we evaluate?
Think of something of genuine interest in discovering about the prototype. It is recommended to base the evaluation around the main focus of the redesign.

The evaluation might be comparative between different products, or versions of a product, or might be standalone evaluations of the prototype. For example, one may

* ask users to compare the redesign with original
* compare desktop and mobile versions of the prototype
* do no comparisons but evaluate only

## How should we conduct the evaluation?
Select between any forms of evaluations covered in the course. Some examples of approaches are:

* design a questionnaire to give users after they have used the product
* design an experiment with independent and dependent variables, and measure user performance in some way
* interview participants
* conduct a focus group with participants
* screen record users using the prototype and/or get them to perform a think-aloud

## What do we need to plan to conduct the evaluation?
Depending on the choices above, different preparation work will be required and/or documents produced. There may be a need to design a series of tasks that a participant will perform, work out technical procedures for screensharing and/or screen recording, write questionnaires, interview questions, introduction scripts etc.
