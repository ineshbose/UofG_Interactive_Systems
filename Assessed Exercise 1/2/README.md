# UI Prototyping

## Figma
This work should be conucting using the online prototyping tool [Figma](https://www.figma.com).

## Designing
Working in teams, use Figma to create an interactive prototype of a redesigned product that improves upon the system evaluated for AE1-1.

## Choice of Product
If the initial product choice was not ideal, steps can be taken to modify it. For example:

* If the chosen product is too simple, design some appropriate additional functionality.
* If the chosen product is too complicated, concentrate on just one section.
* If the chosen product is totally unsuitable, it's OK to select a new product to redesign.

## Report
Produce a short PDF document containing

* Team ID
* URL for an interactive Figma prototype
* State what product was chosen and how close it was to AE1-1
* Summary of what changes were made and why it is an improvement
