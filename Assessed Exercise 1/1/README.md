# Usability Testing

## Select Product
First select a single product for the whole team to study. It could be a web site, or native desktop or mobile app. Maybe there is a system that one or more group members already use and find frustrating.

## Heuristic Evaluation
To evaluate the product, refer to [Nielsen's Ten Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/).

### Individually
Look through the list of heuristics and note down anywhere the product may have problems. Use the system to perform typical tasks, considering at each steps in an interaction how the interface or interaction flow meets or fails to meet recommended heuristic criteria.

### As a Group
Create a master list of everything the team collectively observed. Some issues will likely have been identified by more than one person. Where two people have made similar but different observations, make a judgment as to whether they are similar enough to merge them or if it is worth keeping them separate.

A single person is unlikely to uncover every potential usability problem with a product. However, in combing lists from several testers, a more complete set of the issues can be identified.

## Report
Working as a group, produce a PDF document with the following sections

* Product description: Describe the product being evaluated. Include a couple of screenshots to help describe it.
* Identified issues: Provide the master list of the group's identified issues. For each, note which of Nielsen's principles it violates.
* Diagram: A diagram that illustrates how many of the members uncovered each issue. Number the x-axis, or provide some way of mapping the diagram's columns to the list of issues.
